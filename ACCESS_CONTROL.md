# Access Control

## Core principle: one system, dynamic permissions

This app is **one application** with **one UI, one navigation system, one component system, one feature architecture**. There are no per-role interfaces, duplicate screens, duplicate workflows, or duplicate business logic.

- The **Super Admin view is the baseline**. Every route, page, and menu item the Super Admin can see is the complete set of surface area in the system — nothing else should exist. Anything not visible to Super Admin should not exist elsewhere (no hidden/extra routes for other roles).
- All roles share the same sidebar, routes, and components. Differences between roles are expressed purely as **permissions**, which control:
  - Whether a nav item / route is visible (`canRoute`)
  - Whether a section, button, or action renders
  - Which records are visible within a shared view (row/organization-level scoping)
- New roles must be added by extending permission rules, never by creating new views, pages, or duplicate logic.
- All authenticated users land on `/dashboard` (single entry point, single redirect rule) — the dashboard content itself is scoped by permission, not routed to a different page per role.

## Roles

- `super_admin`
- `acsl_agent_manager`
- `acsl_agent`
- `partner`
- `partner_agent` (a.k.a. `agent`)

Legend: **Full access** = complete module access • **No Access / Hidden** = menu item not visible or restricted for this role.

## Confirmed access rules (source of truth)

- All users log in and land on the same `/dashboard` route (single redirect for all roles).
- All users share the same sidebar and view scaffolding as Super Admin; visibility is filtered via `canRoute` permission checks, not separate layouts.
- Users at every level only see information/records relevant to them (org/assignment-based row scoping).
- **Partners and Partner Agents**: no access to Partner Management or Agent Management.
- **Partners**: no access to the ACSL Agents Performance Report tab.
- **Partners**: in User Management, can create **only** Partner Agent users; the role dropdown is locked to "Partner Agent" and the partner's own organization is preselected in the form (no picker choice).
- **Only Super Admin** has access to: User Groups, Map, Settings.
- **ACSL Agent Managers**: can access records for ACSL agents and partners assigned to them (their own scope), plus records for partners assigned to those partners.
- **Partner Agent dashboard scope is split by data type, not a single blanket rule** — a partner agent is created *under* a partner and inherits that partner's stove ledger, but their own sales are personal:
  - **Stove inventory** (`stovesReceived`, `availableStoves`): scoped to the **whole partner organization** the agent belongs to — same stove IDs the partner themselves sees. The agent didn't personally receive stoves; the org did, and every agent under that org shares visibility into it.
  - **Sales-derived numbers** (`stovesSold`, financial summary — expected receivable / amount received / outstanding balance, sales-by-model, sales-by-state): scoped to **sales attributed to that specific agent only** (`sold_on_behalf_of = agent`), not the whole organization's sales. An agent does not see sales made by other agents under the same partner.
  - Implemented in `supabase/functions/super-admin-agent-dashboard/index.ts` — stove counts query `stove_ids` by `organization_id`; sales counts/financials query `sales` by `sold_on_behalf_of`.

## Per-role sidebar/nav summary

- **super_admin** — everything.
- **acsl_agent_manager** — everything except Map, Settings, User Groups.
- **acsl_agent** — like manager, minus User Management and ACSL Agents Profile (Agent Management → ACSL Agents).
- **partner** — no Partner Management, no ACSL Agents Profile, no Map, no Settings, no User Groups. Performance Report shows the **Partners tab only** (own organization). Still sees User Manager, Partner Agents Profile, Sales, Stove Users Data, Track Stoves.
- **partner_agent / agent** — Dashboard, Sales, Sell Stove, Stove Manager, Stove Users Data, Sales Monitoring App only.

## User Manager (create-user) form rules

- Role dropdown options are filtered based on the caller's own role.
- **Partner caller**: role is locked to `Partner Agent`; the partner/org picker is preselected to their own organization (no other choice).
- **ACSL Manager caller**: can create `ACSL Agent` or `Partner Agent`.
- **Only Super Admin** can create `Partner` users — the Partner option is hidden from the User Group dropdown for every other caller.

## Partner Management scoping (implemented)

- `/partners/profiles` (Partner Management) and `/partners` (Track Performance) are gated by `routeKey` on `ProtectedRoute`, driven by the `PERMISSIONS` route map — `partner` and `partner_agent` are rejected even on direct URL entry (`requireAdminAccess` alone is not enough, since every role has admin-area access).
- The `manage-organizations` edge function authenticates `super_admin` plus `acsl_agent` / `acsl_agent_manager` (and legacy `super_admin_agent`). Non-super-admin roles are **read-only** (GET only) and every read is filtered server-side to `resolveAssignedOrgIds` (direct + state + subordinate-inherited assignments). Writes (create/update/delete/CSV import) remain super-admin only.
- `get-stove-stats` applies the same assignment scoping for ACSL roles; a scoped caller with zero assignments gets zeros, never global stats.
- Both Partner Management screens use one fetch path for every role — the server decides the rows; there is **no client-side filtering of a super-admin dataset** (the old `assignedOrgIds` client filter was removed, since it never worked and isn't security).
- Row actions on Partner Profiles are permission flags on the shared table: `Details` for all roles with the route, `Credentials` behind `can("credentials")`, `Edit` behind `can("edit-any-partner")` (both super-admin-only), matching the read-only "Assigned partners" access of ACSL roles.

## Agent Management scoping (implemented)

- `/agents` (Performance Report tabs), `/agents/profiles` (Agent Management → ACSL Agents), and `/agents/partner-agents-profiles` (Agent Management → Partner Agents) are gated by `routeKey` on `ProtectedRoute` (`agents`, `agents-profiles`, `partner-agents-profiles`), so roles outside the `PERMISSIONS` route map are rejected even on direct URL entry:
  - `agents-profiles` (ACSL Agents): `super_admin` + `acsl_agent_manager` only.
  - `partner-agents-profiles` (Partner Agents): `super_admin`, `acsl_agent_manager`, `acsl_agent`, `partner`. `partner_agent` has no Agent Management access at all.
- Both profile pages share one fetch path for every role — the `manage-users` edge function; the server decides the rows via `scope.ts`:
  - `super_admin` → all users; `acsl_agent_manager` → own subordinate ACSL agents (`manager_id`) + agents of assigned partners; `acsl_agent` → agents of assigned partners only (via `resolveAssignedOrgIds`); `partner` → agents of their own organization.
  - `acsl_agent` callers are **read-only** (GET only) in `manage-users` — writes are rejected in the route handler before dispatch.

## Performance Report scoping (implemented)

`/agents` renders the Performance Report as two tabs on one shared page (`src/app/agents/page.tsx`); the page is gated by `routeKey="agents"`, so `partner_agent`/`agent` are rejected even on direct URL entry.

- **ACSL Agents tab** (`SuperAdminAgentsContent`): shown only when `can("manage-acsl-agents")` (super_admin) or `can("manage-acsl-agents-scoped")` (acsl_agent_manager). Hidden for `acsl_agent` and `partner` per the matrix. The agent list comes from the `manage-users` edge function, which scopes rows server-side (`scope.ts`): super_admin → all, manager → own subordinate ACSL agents + agents of assigned partners. Per-agent performance stats (assigned/collected/in-stock) are derived only from the agents the server returned — there is no separate client-side role filter.
- **Partners tab** (`PartnersContent`): shared by every role with the `agents` route. The partner list comes from `manage-organizations` and KPI numbers from `get-stove-stats`; both scope server-side: super_admin → all orgs; `acsl_agent` / `acsl_agent_manager` → `resolveAssignedOrgIds` (read-only); `partner` (and legacy `admin`) → **own organization only** (read-only, forced to `profiles.organization_id`; zero rows if none). Writes on `manage-organizations` remain super-admin only regardless of tab.
- The old fork where a `partner` caller got a mislabeled "ACSL Agents" tab rendering a separate `PartnerAgentsContent` component was removed (the component was deleted; Agent Management → Partner Agents lives at `/agents/partner-agents-profiles` with its own scoping). Every role now renders the same tab components; only tab visibility and server-side row scoping differ.

## Data scoping

Menu/route visibility is necessary but not sufficient — record-level access must also be enforced wherever a shared view is scoped by organization/assignment (e.g. org filters, RLS in services/edge functions) so that non-admin roles only see rows relevant to them, even inside a shared component.

## Implementation guardrails

- Do not add a route, page, or menu item unless Super Admin also has it. If a feature is role-specific, gate it behind a permission check on the shared component — don't fork a new page for it.
- Do not create a second sidebar, dashboard, or layout for any role. Extend the existing one.
- New roles = new permission entries in the access-control config, not new UI.
- When in doubt about whether a difference between roles should be a new screen or a permission flag: it's a permission flag.
- **No `role === X ? <ViewA/> : <ViewB/>` forks that swap out an entire section/page body.** A component may branch on role to show/hide a toolbar, button, or column, but the core structure (charts, cards, tables) must be the same JSX tree for every role, fed by role-scoped data.
  - Red flag while reviewing a diff: an `if (isSuperAdmin) { ... } else { ... }` (or ternary) that duplicates markup instead of toggling a prop/section. That's a second view in disguise and must be merged into one shared render path.
  - Precedent: the dashboard (`src/app/dashboard/components/DashboardContent.jsx`) originally had exactly this — a full rich view for `super_admin` and a stripped-down KPI-only view for every other role. Fixed by merging into a single render path where all roles get the same charts/cards, and only truly super-admin-only controls (org/state/branch filter toolbar) stay behind an `isSuperAdmin` check inside the shared component. Drilldown-capable roles (`acsl_agent`, `acsl_agent_manager`, `partner`) get clickable KPI tiles instead of navigate-away links — that's a permission-driven *behavior* difference on the same tile, not a different tile.
- When scoping data for a role (edge functions / services), the response shape returned to the frontend must stay identical across roles (same keys) — only the underlying query filter changes (org id, assignment, `created_by`, etc.). This is what lets one component render every role's data without branching on shape.
