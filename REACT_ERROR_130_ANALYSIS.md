# React Error #130 Analysis and Fix

## 🔍 React Error #130 Breakdown

According to React documentation, Error #130 typically occurs when:
1. **Objects are not valid as a React child** - Attempting to render an object directly
2. **Promise rejection during render** - Unhandled promise rejections during component lifecycle
3. **Async operations in render methods** - Attempting to render async results directly

## 🎯 Current Issue Analysis

From the stack trace provided:
```
Error: Minified React error #130; visit https://react.dev/errors/130?args[]=object&args[]= for the full message
```

The `args[]=object&args[]=` suggests the error is specifically about trying to render an object as a React child.

## 🛠️ Likely Causes in Your Sales Page

1. **Pagination object being rendered directly**
2. **Sales data containing objects that React can't render**
3. **Auth state containing non-serializable objects**
4. **Promise objects being passed to React components**

## 🔧 Specific Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Error Boundary
- Catches the specific #130 error pattern
- Clears corrupted localStorage data
- Provides user-friendly recovery options

### 2. Improved Auth Context
- Better handling of session errors
- Proper serialization of auth state
- Cleanup of corrupted session data

### 3. Enhanced useSalesAdvanced Hook
- Better handling of auth state changes
- Proper error boundaries for API calls
- Cleanup of ongoing requests during auth changes

### 4. Sales Service Improvements
- Better token error handling
- Proper error propagation
- Session validation before API calls

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

1. **Add debug component** to identify exact error source
2. **Monitor auth state transitions** during page load
3. **Check for object rendering** in React components
4. **Validate API response structure** for non-renderable objects

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Deploy updated code with debug component
2. Monitor console for specific error patterns
3. Identify exact component causing #130 error
4. Apply targeted fix based on findings
5. Remove debug component once stable

The debug component will help us pinpoint exactly what object is being rendered that shouldn't be.
