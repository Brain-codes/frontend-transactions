## Key Implementation Decisions

1. **Modular Architecture**: Separated concerns into dedicated services and hooks
2. **Reusable Components**: Leveraged existing UI components and patterns
3. **Consistent Styling**: Maintained application's existing design system
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
5. **Performance**: Implemented debouncing, pagination, and optimized API calls
6. **Scalability**: Services designed to handle additional features and endpoints

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test role-based access control with different user types
2. Verify API integration with actual backend endpoints
3. Test form validation and error handling
4. Verify responsive design across devices
5. Test image upload and signature capture functionality

## Future Enhancements

1. Add real-time notifications for pending sales
2. Implement advanced analytics and reporting
3. Add bulk operations for sales management
4. Enhance agent performance tracking
5. Add offline support for sales creation
6. Implement advanced search with autocomplete

This implementation provides a complete admin flow that matches the functionality described in the Flutter documentation while maintaining the existing Next.js application's architecture and design patterns.
