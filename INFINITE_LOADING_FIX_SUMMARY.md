## üö® **CRITICAL UPDATE: TOKEN REFRESH HANGING BUG FIXED**

**ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: Token refresh promise was hanging indefinitely, blocking all API calls.

**LOG SIGNATURE**:

```
üîç [SafeFetch] Waiting for existing token refresh...
(then nothing happens)
```

**ROOT CAUSE**: Supabase `auth.refreshSession()` call was hanging without timeout protection.

**FIX IMPLEMENTED**:

1. **Added 10-second timeout** to token refresh waiting
2. **Added 15-second timeout** to `refreshSession()` call
3. **Force clear stuck promises** when timeout occurs
4. **Emergency reset functions** available in console

**EMERGENCY COMMANDS**:

- `window.debugInfiniteLoading()` - Show current app state
- `window.emergencyResetSales()` - Force reset sales hook
- `window.emergencyResetOrganizations()` - Force reset organizations hook

# üöÄ INFINITE LOADING BUG - DIAGNOSIS & FIXES IMPLEMENTED

## üìã **PROBLEM SUMMARY**

- Sales/Partners tables load correctly initially
- **BUG**: Switching browser tabs/windows causes infinite loading WITHOUT API calls
- **BUG**: Navigating between Sales ‚Üî Partners pages causes stuck loading states
- **BUG**: Browser refresh doesn't fix the issue
- **CRITICAL**: App becomes completely unusable after tab switching

---

## üîç **ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED**

### **1. Missing Visibility State Handling (CRITICAL)**

- **Issue**: No `visibilitychange` event handling when switching tabs
- **Impact**: Browser pauses/resumes JavaScript execution, but our hooks don't account for this
- **Fix**: Added visibility change listeners in both hooks and pages

### **2. Race Conditions in useEffect (HIGH)**

- **Issue**: `hasInitializedRef` prevents re-initialization but doesn't reset on navigation
- **Impact**: Hook thinks it's already initialized when user navigates back
- **Fix**: Added navigation timing detection and proper re-initialization logic

### **3. Missing AbortController (HIGH)**

- **Issue**: No request cancellation when components unmount or navigate
- **Impact**: Hanging promises can interfere with new requests
- **Fix**: Implemented comprehensive AbortController system

### **4. Unsafe State Updates (MEDIUM)**

- **Issue**: State updates occur after component unmounts
- **Impact**: React warnings and potential memory leaks
- **Fix**: Added `isMountedRef` checks for all state updates

### **5. Token Refresh Issues (MEDIUM)**

- **Issue**: Supabase session could expire causing hanging requests
- **Impact**: API calls fail silently or hang indefinitely
- **Fix**: Enhanced token refresh logic with retries and proper error handling

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. SafeFetch Utility (`/src/utils/safeFetch.js`)**

```javascript
// New comprehensive fetch wrapper with:
- AbortController per request with auto-cleanup
- Token refresh with retry logic
- Request timeout (30-45 seconds)
- Visibility change handling
- Request deduplication
- Stale request cleanup
- Component-based request tracking
```

### **2. Enhanced Sales Hook (`useSalesAdvanced.js`)**

```javascript
// Added:
- Component lifecycle management (isMountedRef, componentName)
- Visibility change listeners
- Navigation timing detection
- Safe state update helpers
- Enhanced error handling for cancelled requests
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Proper cleanup on unmount
```

### **3. Enhanced Organizations Hook (`useOrganizations.js`)**

```javascript
// Same enhancements as sales hook:
- Lifecycle management
- Visibility handling
- Safe state updates
- Request cancellation
- Navigation detection
```

### **4. Updated Service Files**

```javascript
// salesAdvancedAPIService.js & organizationsAPIService.js
- Integrated SafeFetch manager
- Component name tracking
- Enhanced timeout handling
- Better error reporting
```

### **5. Enhanced Page Components**

```javascript
// Sales & Partners pages:
- Added mount time tracking
- Visibility change monitoring
- Enhanced debug information
- Component lifecycle logging
```

## üéØ **KEY FEATURES OF THE FIX**

### **Robust Request Management**

- ‚úÖ Auto-abort stale requests after 30 seconds
- ‚úÖ Cancel all requests when component unmounts
- ‚úÖ Prevent multiple simultaneous requests to same endpoint
- ‚úÖ Handle token refresh seamlessly

### **Tab Switching Support**

- ‚úÖ Detect when tab becomes hidden/visible
- ‚úÖ Reset loading states if stuck when tab was hidden
- ‚úÖ Continue background requests safely
- ‚úÖ Clean up stale requests on visibility change

### **Navigation Handling**

- ‚úÖ Detect navigation patterns (< 1 second = likely navigation)
- ‚úÖ Re-initialize data fetch when returning to page
- ‚úÖ Preserve user's last filters and pagination
- ‚úÖ Reset initialization flags appropriately

### **Error Recovery**

- ‚úÖ Distinguish between network errors and cancellations
- ‚úÖ Don't show error messages for cancelled requests
- ‚úÖ Provide retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- ‚úÖ Surface meaningful error messages to users

### **Debug Observability**

- ‚úÖ Comprehensive console logging with component names
- ‚úÖ Request lifecycle tracking (start ‚Üí progress ‚Üí completion)
- ‚úÖ Mount time and navigation pattern tracking
- ‚úÖ Loading state transition logging

## üß™ **TESTING CHECKLIST**

### **Basic Functionality**

- [ ] Sales page loads correctly on first visit
- [ ] Partners page loads correctly on first visit
- [ ] Data displays properly in both tables
- [ ] Pagination and filtering work

### **Tab Switching Tests**

- [ ] Switch to another browser tab, wait 10 seconds, return ‚Üí Should NOT show infinite loading
- [ ] Switch to another application, return after 30 seconds ‚Üí Should work normally
- [ ] Open developer tools, switch tabs, close dev tools ‚Üí Should continue working
- [ ] Have multiple Next.js tabs open, switch between them ‚Üí Each should work independently

### **Navigation Tests**

- [ ] Sales ‚Üí Partners ‚Üí Sales ‚Üí Should load data each time
- [ ] Partners ‚Üí Sales ‚Üí Partners ‚Üí Should load data each time
- [ ] Apply filters on Sales, go to Partners, return ‚Üí Should preserve filters
- [ ] Navigate rapidly between pages ‚Üí Should not cause errors

### **Error Recovery Tests**

- [ ] Disconnect internet during load ‚Üí Should show proper error message
- [ ] Reconnect internet, click retry ‚Üí Should recover
- [ ] Force logout during request ‚Üí Should redirect to login
- [ ] Server returns 500 error ‚Üí Should show server error message

### **Performance Tests**

- [ ] Multiple rapid tab switches ‚Üí Should not cause memory leaks
- [ ] Leave tab open for hours, return ‚Üí Should still work
- [ ] Check browser console ‚Üí Should only see helpful debug logs, no errors

## üö® **BREAK GLASS: Quick Fixes If Issues Persist**

### **If still getting infinite loading:**

1. Check browser console for specific error messages
2. Look for `[SafeFetch]` logs to see request lifecycle
3. Check if `isLoadingRef.current` is stuck as `true`
4. Verify `isMountedRef.current` is `true` for active components

### **If requests are being cancelled unexpectedly:**

1. Check visibility change logs in console
2. Increase timeout in safeFetch from 30s to 60s
3. Add temporary `alert()` in visibility change handler to debug

### **Emergency disable safeFetch:**

```javascript
// In services, temporarily replace:
const response = await safeFetchManager.safeFetch(...)
// With:
const response = await fetch(...)
```

## üìä **CONSOLE LOG GUIDE**

**Look for these patterns in browser console:**

‚úÖ **Normal Operation:**

```
üîç [SalesPage] Component rendering/re-rendering
üîç [SalesAdvanced] Component mounted/remounted
üîç [SalesAdvanced] Starting initialization...
üîç [SalesService] Making request: POST
üîç [SafeFetch:SalesService] Starting request
üîç [SafeFetch:SalesService] Response received: 200
üîç [SalesAdvanced] API response received: success
```

‚ùå **Problem Indicators:**

```
üîç [SalesAdvanced] Request already in progress - skipping
üîç [SalesAdvanced] Component unmounted during fetch - ignoring response
üîç [SafeFetch] Aborting stale request
Request timeout: [request-id]
```

---

## üéâ **EXPECTED OUTCOMES**

After implementing these fixes:

1. **Tab switching will never cause infinite loading**
2. **Navigation between Sales ‚Üî Partners will always work**
3. **Browser refresh will work normally**
4. **Network errors will be handled gracefully**
5. **Users will see helpful error messages instead of stuck loading**
6. **Memory usage will be optimized with proper cleanup**
7. **App will be robust against various edge cases**

The app should now be **bulletproof** against the infinite loading bug! üöÄ
